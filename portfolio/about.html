                    <p> My name is Sujata, and people call me Suzzi. I was born in India. </p>
                    <p> The chef's life and kitchen life have raised my curiosity since I was 14 and experimenting with new cake recipes has been a hobby of mine ever since. I remember the very first time I found out about Le Cordon Bleu. I saw it on the back of a magazine while I was on a ferry to Singapore. At that moment, it was the first time in my life that I found something that I really want more than anything in the world, and I'm willing to give everything that I have in order to get it. It felt like falling in love.</p> 
                    <p> I finished my secondary school at a very young age which doesnâ€™t make it any easier for me to get into a culinary school which the age requirement is usually 18 yo and above. My parents prevented me from traveling on my own, the reason was because I was too young to live on my own, so I moved to Melbourne, Australia in February 2013 with the support of my mother. I studied Hospitality and Patisserie at William Angliss Institute for one semester (6 months).</p> 
                    <p> I moved to Le Cordon Bleu Wellington, New Zealand in October 2013 after I was given freedom from my parents! It was most definitely a dream come true. I was in the Le Grand Diplome course which is a combination of two courses of Diplome de Cuisine and Diplome de Patisserie. I decided to do both at the same time and it was the best decision that I've ever made. I graduated in May 2014 when I was 17. </p>
